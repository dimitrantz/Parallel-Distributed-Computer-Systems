# Parallel-Distributed-Computer-Systems
7th semester (Oct 2016 - Jan 2017)

Series of project to:
- Understand parallel computer architectures
- Learn common parallel algorithms and design new ones.
- Learn how to write parallel programs

## Project#1 - Octree
Creation of an octree with the Morton Code technique. The steps done are the following:

- Hash code calculation
- Bit interleaving
- Most significant digit radix sort
- Reclassification

The serial code was given and the parallel code was made using Cilk, OpenMP and Pthreads.

Language: C

## Project#2 - Game of life
Simulation of the cellular automaton Game of Life. The serial code was given and the parallel code was made using MPI and OpenMP.

Language: C

## Project#3 - Non local means
MATLAB code was given that implements the pipeline of the Non Local Means algorithm for image denoising. Our task was to improve its performance using CUDA.

Language: MATLAB, CUDA C

## Project#4 - Backpropagation
This project implements the parallel version of the Backpropagation algorithm for neural networks training, using CUDA.

Language: C
